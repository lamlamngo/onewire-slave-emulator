\page history History and release notes for this library collection.

Next release:
- No changes yet

8-Dec-2017:

- Cleanup of unnecessary warnings during scons builds.
- Additional 40 MHz clocks now supported by the ECAN module.

- Fixes to various project files so they'll build.

25-Aug-2013 (r385 / e818e78a9810):

- More projects converted to MPLAB X.
- Rewrites to chap 8, 9 files for the book.
- Support for deviecs with hardmapped UART pins (28-pin PIC24FK, for example).
- Combined pic24_e/fh_ports.h into a single file, added support for PIC24FK
  analog config.
- Doxygen comments added to every GPIO config macro.
- New ESOS features: mailboxes and more.
- _NOFLOAT actually removes all floats in the library.

09-Jul-2013 (r267 / 992b80bc0901):
This is a major release / revision in the beta stage. The upcoming book will
provide a full description. Just a few highlights:
- Update to MPLAB X.
- Revised GPIO system.
- Updates to code examples for revision of book.
- Updated build system.
- Refactored bootloader now makes use of the PIC24 library, not a custom
  cut-and-paste.

23-May-2013 (r65 / f5e398dc9af3):
- Merge the lib/ subrepo into the main repo.
- Clean up Doxygen / compiler warnings.
- Updated to AStyle 2.03, ran AStyle.

11-Nov-2013 (r61 / 3dfae4d8075a)
- Changed function names 'ConfigOutputCapture1' to 'ConfigOutputCompare1' as
  that is what is really being configured.
- Changed ledpwm.c back to reflect what is in the book/notes.
- Added ledpwm_bullymon project that demonstrates  usage of variable monitoring
  in Bully Bootloader.
- Add: batch files to flash bootloader images
- Fixed error in chapter 5 problem 27 solution.

  disrupting an attached crystal oscillator.
- Moved repo hosting to Bitbucket
- Fixed compile errors in ESOS
- Update docs generation to include ESOS. Tidyed up doxygen a bit.
- lib/common/pic24_stdio_uart.c, chap10/stdio_test.* fixed, updated so
